## Easy Vegetable Lo Mein
This veggie-packed lo mein is a filling, super fast, super easy noodle stir fry. It uses staple vegetables like cabbage and carrots, with bell peppers for a pop of color. Use what you have on hand — lo mein is a great mix and match meal.

## What Are Lo Mein Noodles?
There are many kinds of noodles you can use for stir-fries like this. Lo mein noodles come in a variety of diameters but are typically made with wheat.

In most supermarkets, you can find the fresh noodles in the chilled section of the grocery store, but at a minimum, they will have a dried noodle that you can find in the Asian section. For stir-fry noodles, I recommend using a thicker noodle, not the super thin noodle that you might find in a ramen package.

## What Is in Lo Mein Sauce?
I keep the sauce for this recipe very simple, but it still has plenty of flavor. It’s a mix of the following:

- Hoisin sauce
- Soy sauce
- Sesame oil
- Water

I like to make a bit more sauce for Veggie Lo Mein than in my Chicken Lo Mein recipe, because there is more volume with the veggies. A little more sauce helps tie everything together.

## Vegetable Swaps and Substitutions
I stick with classic stir fry vegetables for this version: mushrooms, red pepper, cabbage, and carrot. But don’t let that limit you! SO many vegetables would go just fine in this stir fry. Here are a few ideas!

- Peas
- Chopped asparagus
- Sliced zucchini
- Baby spinach
- Tiny eggplants


### SERVINGS
4 servings

## Ingredients

### For the sauce:
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup hot water
- 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil

### For the lo mein:

- 10 ounces lo mein noodles, fresh or dry
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced
- 1 red pepper, sliced
- 1 carrot, grated
- 1 small head napa cabbage, chopped

### To garnish:
- Fresh scallion, chopped
- Sesame seeds
- Wasabi edamame


## Method

### 1. Combine the sauce ingredients:
In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, hot water, hoisin sauce, and sesame oil.

### 2. Cook the lo mein noodles:
Fill a large pot with water and set it over medium heat. Add the salt and bring the water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender, usually around 4 minutes, but check the package directions for the noodles you are using.

Drain the noodles, transfer to a bowl, and toss with sesame oil to prevent sticking.

### 3. Cook the vegetables:
Set a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add olive oil along with the sliced mushrooms, and stir fry for 2-3 minutes until the mushrooms lose their water and start to brown slightly. Then add the red pepper, carrot, and cabbage. Continue to cook for about 3 minutes, stirring regularly until the vegetables are wilted.

### 4. Add the noodles and sauce:
Add noodles along with the sauce and stir with the vegetables to combine. The sauce should coat the noodles and vegetables. If the noodles seem dry, add more water, a tablespoon at a time.

Taste and adjust the flavor to your liking. It might need another dash of soy sauce, for example.

### 5. Serve:
Serve the Veggie Lo Mein topped with scallions, sesame seeds, and wasabi edamame (if you like it hot) for some nice spicy crunch.

Leftovers! You can store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days. They will reheat beautifully in the microwave.
