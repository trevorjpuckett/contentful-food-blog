# Quick and Easy Green Smoothie
Healthy green smoothie with banana, pineapple, spinach, and Greek yogurt.

Do you ever find it challenging to eat all of your recommended daily servings of fruits and vegetables each day? Sometimes I do. And, I admit it. I’m a little late to the game on this one.

For years I’ve been hearing people talk about adding greens like kale or spinach to their morning smoothies, saying, “You don’t even know it’s in there.” Well, I didn’t buy it. Until, I tried it. Now, greens are a regular feature in my morning smoothies.


Adding plain Greek yogurt along with the fruits and spinach increases the protein content, making this smoothie an easy and fulfilling meal. You can sneak all kinds of other good things in, too.


I like to add a teaspoon of coconut oil, enhancing both the flavor and the health benefits of the drink. Many parents find green smoothies are an enticing way to get their young ones to eat an extra serving of greens.

Do you slip greens into your smoothies? If so, please tell us about it in the comments.

**NOTE:** If you want to add coconut oil, be sure it’s slightly melted when you add it so it emulsifies and blends well into the smoothie. Otherwise, it might be lumpy, especially if you are using frozen pineapple or if you add ice cubes.
If you use canned pineapple, you can add the juice, too, for a sweeter tasting smoothie
